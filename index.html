                    <p> In general, getting distracted by the use of technology is easy and can
                        add to the never ending cycle of procrastination. One example that is not
                        so obvious is music. It definitely depends on the person and the type of music,
                        but it can still cause people to postpone their work if they are jamming out to
                        their favorite songs.
                    </p>
                    <p> I will be using The Stack model to illustrate the different layers
                        of music.

                    <h2>User</h2>
                    <p> In the User layer, the person who is listening to the music while doing their 
                        work is the user.

                    <h2>Interface</h2>
                    <p> The tool that the User is using to listen to music is the Interface.
                        This can include mp3 players, ipods, phones, ipads, computers, and other less
                        technical items like a cd player, cassette player, and record player.

                    <h2>Address</h2>
                    <p> Focusing more on the digital age, the music apps based through the internet
                        are considered to be the Address in which music content is gathered and streamed.
                        For example, Spotify, Apple Music, Pandora, SoundCloud, etc.

                    <h2>City</h2>
                    <p> The City level is the internet which connects users to music media around the world.
                        It can also connect content creators, musicians, and consumers/listeners to each
                        other to share and enjoy music.

                    <h2>Cloud</h2>
                    <p> The Cloud is the huge databases of each music app that collects all of this music
                        data. It stores the information for people so they can stream the music over the 
                        internet.

                    <p> The Earth is the ground level where music is made. Taking it back, it can include
                        the various of instruments that create music, but it can also include the musicians
                        who write the songs we listen to.
